                        <p>• Log information – When you access Dbitlab via a browser, application or other client our servers automatically record certain information. These server logs may include information such as your web request, your interaction with our web site, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your account.</p>

                        <h4>Information security</h4>
                        <p>We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, including appropriate encryption and physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.
